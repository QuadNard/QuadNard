 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
As a self-driven and ambitious individual , I have spent the last two years honing my skills and expanding my knowledge on the industry. I have gained experience working with a variety of technologies and tools, including JavaScript frameworks such as Next.js and React.js. 

My experience working on real-world projects and interacting with other engineers in the field has allowed me to develop a strong understanding of the software development process, from designing and building scalable and performant applications, to integrating third-party APIs and ensuring that data is securely stored and processed.

I am particularly interested in the user experience aspect of web development, and system design I am always looking for ways to improve the interaction between users and the applications I build. This has led me to focus on areas such as real-time data updates and secure payment processing, and I am constantly seeking out new opportunities to learn and grow in these areas.

I am excited to continue my career as a software engineer, and I look forward to the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to a more managerial position and challenging projects in the future.🙂
