I‚Äôm currently working at Freelance Org and working on some interesting stuff like modular monolith Back Ends, remote packages and low-code efficiency. And a super-efficient shared development model. At this stage I am learning some knowledge about ML computations. If you are also interested in these, let us create fun works together, please follow meüòÄ.
